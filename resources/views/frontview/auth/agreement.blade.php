Personally identifiable information (also known as &#39;personal data&#39;) is information about you that can be used, directly or indirectly, to identify you (name, address, telephone number, date of birth, email address, etc.). Data that does not allow identification of you, for example data anonymized, is not considered personally identifiable information.</p>
